    <h2>Favorite Book</h2>
    <p>
        Cy-Believers is a book I have just read for the 2nd time in the past couple of months. The book is a romantic comedy manga book made by Shioko Mizuki.    </p>
    <p>
        The manga is based around a girl named Rui with a very smart and very overprotective dad that interrogates people for a living. As soon as she moved schools her dad learned about everyone she was hanging around and put mics on them to check on their daily lives with her. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Rui and Kai were having relationship struggles with other people while they both had feelings for each other. Their goals were to not get in the way of the others' love lives, that did not happen. This was all happening while their school club was rioting.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would rate the 1st manga a 7/10 just because it was a little slow with major events happening. However it was a funny and great story with a cliffhanger.
        I would recommend this book to manga lovers and people who like romcoms.
