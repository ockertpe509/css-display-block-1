    <h2>Smart/Academic Goals</h2>
    <p>
        My academic goal for 2023 is to create a working webpage with links. I want to get better at programming and I had given myself a difficult challenge but I finally made a webpage with not just links but pictures and backgrounds as well.

        My personal smart goal for this year was to get abs. I have not gotten abs yet but I have been working hard at it. Before the end of the year I will most likely have them with how much Iâ€™ve been going to the gym. 
        My long term goal is to get into college and become a web designer for a big company. Going through this year I have learned a lot about html programming and I know it will help to reach my long term goals.
