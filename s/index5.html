    <h2>Favorite hobby</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite hobby to do while not in school or at work is playing video games. I am happy when I am playing a video game with a friend even if I don’t like the game. To me it is a good way to spend your free time and it is a great stress reliever. Especially after a hard day of school and work, and then your friend tells you to hop on a game and just enjoy their company and forget about the struggles of your day. Playing video games isn’t just about having a good time either, there are games like Rocket league that have ranked matches which makes the game more intriguing and difficult. Video games have a big variety of genres  and some even teach you important things for real life like Gta V.
